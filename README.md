2WD Software Controller for Arduino with MotorShield

Features:
- wheel encoders for precise wheel movements
- API for movement(forward/backward) and turning(left/right), evaluated with wheel rotations

Depends on:
- motor library
- interrupt_system library
* libraries from other repository of mine, named "Arduino"
